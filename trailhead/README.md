#Trailhead Coins
Do you like the trailhead icons?  Of course you do!  Well, if you have access to a 3d printer, you can print your own trailhead coins!
#Printer Settings
I have tested the following printer settings with [Hatchbox 1.75mm PLA](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J0GPC80/) on a [Printrbot Simple Metal](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IZYL7IW/).  You may have to tweak them based on your printer and filiment.
* Layer Height: 0.1mm
* Shell Thickness: 0.8mm
* Bottom / Top Thickness: 0.4mm
* Print Speed: 45mm/s
* Printing Temp: 210C

#Want More Coins?
I've done designs based on the icons that I like the best.  If you don't see your favorite on here, look through the [issues](https://github.com/pcon/printing/issues) to see if someone has requested it.  If it's not there, file a new [issue](https://github.com/pcon/printing/issues/new) and I'll try to get to it ASAP.
